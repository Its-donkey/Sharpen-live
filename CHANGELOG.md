# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
- Persist admin and YouTube alert configuration in PostgreSQL via a dedicated settings store and API bootstrap flow.
- Surface recent YouTube subscription activity through an admin monitor endpoint for troubleshooting PubSub workflows.
- Store site settings as individual key/value rows in PostgreSQL for easier inspection and manual edits.
- Fail admin settings updates when the settings store cannot persist changes, leaving runtime state untouched so operators see database outages immediately.
- Add a “Monitor” tab in the admin console to review recent YouTube PubSub subscription events.
- Expose YouTube alert subscription settings in the admin UI for runtime configuration.
- Automatically subscribe resolved YouTube channels to PubSubHubbub using the configured callback and secret.
- Log and bind the API server using the listen address persisted in `site_settings`, updating the runtime environment to match.
- Restore `/docs` Jekyll site scaffold so GitHub Pages builds succeed and highlight current repo layout.
- Implement Sharpen Live API service with JSON-backed storage, admin endpoints, and accompanying tests plus local Go module packaging.
- Rebuild the Sharpen Live frontend as a React application with submission workflow, admin dashboard, and Vite toolchain.
- Add `scripts/online.sh`/`make online` dev launcher, default API port 8880, and updated client configuration to target the new endpoints.

- Require admin console authentication via email/password login endpoint and React UI update.
- Move admin tools to dedicated `/admin` route with router-based navigation and dev-prefilled credentials.
- Auto-detect data directory when the API runs from module subdirectory to avoid missing JSON files.
- Extract Sharpen Live landing page styles into `frontend/styles.css` and generate the streamer roster from JSON with live-aware platform links.

- Relocate static site assets from `doc/` to `frontend/`.
- Add YouTube alert listener service that polls live status every five minutes.
- Record YouTube alert listener logs in PostgreSQL for the Admin monitor view.
- Modularize YouTube alert application with dedicated packages and automated tests.
- Add `frontend/streamers.json` to track streamer metadata.
- Restructure repository into `backend/` and `frontend/` applications with shared tooling paths and remove the legacy `web/` duplicate.
- Merge the legacy `api/` module into `backend/` so there is a single Go service.
- Update API default static directory to `frontend/dist` so the merged bundle serves by default.
- Add Go unit tests covering configuration, middleware, and SPA handler utilities.
- Provide default admin token in dev launcher so backend starts without extra env vars.
- Embed the persisted listen address into the SPA and let the frontend derive its API base from `site_settings`.

- Refresh submission form to auto-set status and manage languages via curated dropdown with removable chips.
- Display language names as “English / français”-style labels in the submission picker.
- Add admin dashboard tabs for streamers and settings, including editable environment values.
